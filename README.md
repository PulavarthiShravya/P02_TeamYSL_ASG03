Quizzo is a web application designed by Shravya and Ywe Lin. This application is created to entertain people of all ages. From kids all the way to adults. These quizzes are categorised based on entertaining and educational quizzes.

## Design Process ##
This website is catered for people of all ages. The web application is categorized to 3 main categories (refer to table below for age description). Many of us these days are addicted to our digital devices and most of us use it for entertainment purposes, e.g Netflix, Facebook, Instagram etc. Thus, this web application would help allow us, users, to learn various skills such as MY SQL, about animals or even health. Instead of spending time on social media, why not use that time to entertain ourselves while learning on the go? Hence, through this web application, we believe that it would allow one to get relax, get entertained while gaining unlimited new knowledge.

### Our Learning Experiences ###
- Shravya
    - Given the fact that we started our project a little late due to other assignments have early due dates, the first few days were slightly stressful as I was worried that the project would not be handed in time. However I enjoyed doing this project as I learned more on Javascript such as using css in JS and using html elements as well. And I would not have done it without my partner too.  :palm_tree: :new_moon_with_face:

- Ywe Lin
    - To be honest, I was a bit scared to start this project at first since I feel like I'm weak in ID. However, once I started, I was drawn to it. My partner, Shravya was also really helpful and inspiring to me. I believe we both did great job!!:+1: I got more in-depth knowledge about javascript, json and other related topics such as using local storage and fetch throughout the project.
