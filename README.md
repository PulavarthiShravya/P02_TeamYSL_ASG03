This website is catered for people of all ages. The web application is categorized to 3 main categories (refer to table below for age description). Many of us these days are addicted to our devices. However most of us use it for entertainment purposes, e.g Netflix, Facebook, Instagram etc. Thus, this web application would help allow us users to learn various skills such as MY SQL, about animals or even health. Instead of spending time on social media why not use that time to entertain ourselves while learning on the go? Hence through this web application we believe that it would allow one to get relax, get entertained while gaining new knowledge.
